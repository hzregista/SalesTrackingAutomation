# SalesTrackingAutomation
 

This application I developed for a website is for a company to keep and manage information about its sales. I used the multi-layered architectural structure in this project that I developed in accordance with OOP principles.  

I used related tables in this application which has tables where the information of customers, products and staff are kept. In this way, information such as the personnel selling the product, the customer where the product is sold can be followed easily.
